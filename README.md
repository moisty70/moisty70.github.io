## Welcome to my GitHub website for development of plugin for bookie odds

**Our objetive is to mantain a odds database** along the time to compare it with the results of every betting market. After that we will proccess all the data obtained to start compiling many statistics and use them to create great content for our websites.

**The first website that will have this data shown** will be a spanish site called apuestas de futbol [use this link to check](http://www.apuestafutbol.net/codigo-promocional/bet365-2015.html). Is a spanish football website that will be a great place to test all this data because of the amount of visitors that receives every day.

We are in test fase, just getting data from the sources to the database, all the data will be shown no earlier than the begining of the 2017/18 football season.

## Sources

The coutes are get from the official source of each bookie. Only some of them have this feature available to the affiliates so not all the bookies will be shown at the data.

This is not a big issue due to the similarity of the odds for almost all the bookies, the are barely slightly differences so with 3 bookies should be enough, we will use at least 4.

The first bookies that sent us data are:
1. Bet365
The top bookie gave us access to the odds feeds so will be in the data processed.
2. luckia
Spanish bookies
3. marathon.bet
Another bookie with great odds.
4. William H.
Well know bookie.
